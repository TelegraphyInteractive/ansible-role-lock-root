Role Name
=========

Create a user for ansible, and lock down access to the root user.

Requirements
------------

None.

Role Variables
--------------

The following are the variables used by the role and their defaults.

```YAML
ansible_user: ansible
ansible_user_shell: /bin/bash
```

```YAML
ansible_user_public_keys:
  - ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
```

It is crucial that a valid SSH key be added for the user since that is the only way to login as the user.

Dependencies
------------

None.

Example Playbook
----------------

Running the role is fairly straightforward. The only issue is that if access to
the root user has already been disabled, the role might fail to connect if run
again.

    - hosts: all
      remote_user: root
      roles:
         - { role: cdriehuys.lock-root, ansible_user: ansible }
